    <p>
      Eagle is the common name for many large birds of prey of the family
      Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are
      closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and
      Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be foundâ€”2 in North
      America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia.</p>
